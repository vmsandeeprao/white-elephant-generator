# White Elephant Gift Exchange Name Generator
About the game: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_elephant_gift_exchange

This is a simple script that generates names of friends in random order to pick a gift for White Elephant (aka Yankee Swap). I'm creating this since I did not see any White Elephant Name Generators out there. There are only Secret Santa generators. 


## Instructions on how to run the game: 

1. To use this program, simply create a text file with all the names of friends you want to play White Elephant with. Enter one name per line. If you create the file in your Downloads folder with name "elephant.py", then you won't need to enter the filepath. 

2. Simply run the script "elephant.py" in the command line terminal ('python elephant.py') and pass in the path to the file. You can then use command 'n' to have the script tell who should play the next game.
